# Overview
* "Oh, oops. I accidentally deleted the entire production GCP environment."
* "Production is down, I thought I deleted our test instances -- woopsie!"

...and other things you won't need to say once you use this extension.

This firefox plugin gives you a nice red border when you are in an environment which you have labelled as production. No more accidental things (note: this does not entirely solve the problem between the screens and the chair, but it sure is handy to have around when messing with production.)

## Usage
After installing you may configure the extension by opening it, and then configuring it.

The system currently supports the following:
 * Matching via partial project name
 * Matching via Regex patterns
 * Matching as if a literal

Basically, we support regex tag selection.
